## Elden Ring Quiz

## Description
I wanted to create a unique quiz that would track high scores, deduct time for wrong answers and show my love for the future 2022 game of the year Elden Ring. 

This quiz is styled after the game and deducts 10 seconds off the clock for each incorrect answer given and will tell you whether or not you answered your question correctly below, before allowing you to enter your initial and record your high score.

## Installation
This quiz can be accessed by deployed the application from GitHub and is played in your web browser.
